GENERATE 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total), all with the same population mean.

Include a Normal, a Poisson, a Binomial, a Chi-Squared distribution, and 1 more of your choice.

For each sample PLOT the sample mean (dependent var.) against the sample size N (independent var.) (if you want you can do it with the sample standard deviation as well).

DESCRIBE (in a caption to your figure) the behavior you see in the plots in terms of the law of large numbers or Central Limit Theorem.

PLOT the distributions of all sample means (together for all distributions). Mandatory: as a histogram. Optional: in any other way you think is convincing
