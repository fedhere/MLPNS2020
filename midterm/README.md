This exercise combines the two machine learning methods that you have learned so far in this course: linear regression and clustering. 

There are multiple tasks and for some of them, **if you cannot complete the taks,  there are partial solutions you can access** so you donâ€™t get stuck and can continue the exercise and demonstrate your ability to do the following tasks. I strongly encourage you to do so: there are 10 tasks and you only have ~2 hours! If any task takes you more than 20 minutes you should use the shortcut. You can also use a shortcut then go back to write the relevant code if you have time. So long as the notebook runs (so comment out partial code) you will get point for each completed task.

I have collected from the World Bank database population grows time series for several countries. 

## The overall goal is to identify countries that have similar population growth trends over the years and possibly countries that have anomalous population growth. 

You will be guided to 
- acquire the data, 
- explore it and prepare it, 
- fit a linear model to the each time series, 
- use the parameters you obtain from that fit as input feature to K-means clustering to group countries based on the trends in the population growth. 
- You will also be asked to look inside the group and if you have time identify reasons why the Countries within the clusters that may suggest why the trends are similar (thiw sill be very speculative of course)

**Make sure you show the characteristics of your data at every step** (by printing the shape of the data, the head of the data, the summary statistics of the data, or plot the data, whichever is apprioriate). 

**Every plot needs to have axis labels and a caption that describes what is being plotted and what should be noted in the plot** (e.g. global trends in the time series)

Your "grade" will be based on the rendered notebook, i.e. on the summary a tables and the plots as I see them and the captions that describe them (the captions can be markdown cells in the notebook).

After grading your notebook based on the rendered version I will restart it and run it. If it runs and produces  identical results you will get 100% of the points awarded in the previous step. Otherwise you will get 75%. **Make sure you stop a few minutes before the time expires to rerun the notebook!**
